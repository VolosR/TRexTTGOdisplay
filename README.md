# TRexTTGOdisplay

This is a fork of the TRexTTGOdisplay code.

Made some significant code changes for the screen brightness controls (now done thru an interrupt service routine).

Refactored some of the variables, cleaned up code structure and formatting.

Game now resets after failing level.

Score calculation is now based on start time of the game instead of just the millis count.
